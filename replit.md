# MCP Whois/RDAP Server

## Overview

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Whois and RDAP (Registration Data Access Protocol) lookup services for domain names and IP addresses. The server implements the MCP specification for JSON-RPC 2.0 communication and offers both traditional Whois queries via TCP and modern RDAP queries via HTTPS.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **MCP Server Layer**: Handles JSON-RPC 2.0 communication and MCP protocol compliance
- **Service Layer**: Core business logic for Whois and RDAP lookups
- **Model Layer**: Pydantic data models for request/response validation and serialization
- **Utility Layer**: Common functionality for validation, parsing, and rate limiting
- **Configuration Layer**: Environment-based configuration management

The architecture is designed for asynchronous operations using Python's asyncio framework, enabling high-performance concurrent request handling.

## Key Components

### Core Services
- **WhoisService**: Handles asynchronous TCP connections to Whois servers worldwide
- **RDAPService**: Manages HTTPS requests to RDAP servers with bootstrap registry support
- **CacheService**: In-memory LRU cache with TTL support for performance optimization
- **MCPServer**: Main server implementing the Model Context Protocol specification

### Data Models
- **Domain Models**: `WhoisResult`, `RDAPResult`, `DomainInfo` for structured domain data
- **MCP Models**: Protocol-compliant request/response models for JSON-RPC communication

### Utilities
- **Validators**: Input validation for domain names and IP addresses
- **Parsers**: Whois response parsing with support for various registry formats
- **Rate Limiter**: Token bucket implementation with per-client and global rate limiting

### Configuration
Environment-based configuration supporting:
- Server binding (host/port)
- Connection timeouts and pooling
- Rate limiting parameters
- Cache settings (TTL, size limits)
- Logging configuration

## Data Flow

1. **Request Processing**: MCP client sends JSON-RPC request
2. **Validation**: Input validation for domain/IP format
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-client and global rate limit enforcement
4. **Cache Check**: Attempt to serve from cache if available
5. **Service Dispatch**: Route to appropriate service (Whois/RDAP)
6. **Data Retrieval**: Query external servers with connection pooling
7. **Response Parsing**: Parse and structure response data
8. **Caching**: Store results in cache for future requests
9. **Response**: Return structured JSON-RPC response to client

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **anyio**: Async I/O abstraction layer
- **httpx**: HTTP client for RDAP queries with connection pooling
- **pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **structlog**: Structured logging
- **click**: Command-line interface framework

### Registry Integrations
- **IANA RDAP Bootstrap**: Dynamic server discovery
- **Global Whois Servers**: Comprehensive TLD and RIR coverage
- **RDAP Servers**: Modern structured data access

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for containerized deployment with:

- **Environment Variables**: Complete configuration via environment
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of connections and background tasks
- **Health Monitoring**: Structured logging for observability
- **Resource Management**: Connection pooling and rate limiting for stability

The server can be deployed as:
- Standalone Python application
- Docker container
- Part of a larger microservices architecture

  * Created deployment configuration guide
  * Verified all endpoints respond correctly for deployment health checks
  * Created deployment verification script and configuration fix documentation
  * Application is fully ready for deployment - only .replit port mapping needs correction

- June 29, 2025. Deployment reconfiguration completed
  * Created dedicated deployment script (replit_deploy.py) with optimized health checks
  * Added comprehensive status endpoint (/status) with deployment readiness information
  * Implemented proper HEAD request support for all endpoints
